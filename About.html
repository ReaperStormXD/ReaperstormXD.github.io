            My name is Nihal Naik, I completed my elementary school from A.J.DE.Almeida High School. In 2019 I graduated from G.V.M`s SNJA Higher Secondary School in the stream of science.And taken Computer Science has an alternate subject for biology ,from that point I had developed an interest in programming. Fascinated by the power of coding languages that could implement various complex mechanism used in out day-to-day life, forming the very basis of today`s technology. That fascination drived me in Information Technology as my engineering course for Bachelor`s degree.Currently I study in Goa College of Engineering for completing my degree in IT.
